/**
 * Seestack site configuration
 * =============================================================================
 * This is the single place to edit the content that changes over time:
 * the featured video, the external links in the header/footer, and the email
 * signup provider.
 *
 * Nothing here is a secret. Everything in this file ships to the browser, so
 * never put API keys or tokens in it — use environment variables for those.
 *
 * Anything set to `null` renders as a clearly-marked placeholder instead of a
 * broken or fabricated link. Fill a value in and the UI upgrades itself to a
 * real link automatically. No component changes required.
